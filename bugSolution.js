The solution is to access `this.props` and `this.state` only after the component has mounted.

Using Lifecycle Methods:
```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Now this.props.someProp is defined
    this.setState({ count: this.props.initialCount || 0 }); // Safe to use this.props now
  }

  render() {
    return <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>;
  }
}
```

Using React Hooks:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(props.someProp); // Access props after mount
    setCount(props.initialCount || 0); 
  }, [props.initialCount]);

  return <Text>{count}</Text>;
}
```

Using Hooks is generally preferred for its cleaner syntax and better handling of state updates.  Remember that if `props.initialCount` might change, this would result in the useEffect being called again, so it's good practice to only include that in the dependency array.
